                I am an experienced information technologist with a history of working in the non-profit sector. 

My professional experiences have allowed me to understand the importance of human components for the success of a system. I undertook an MSc in Advanced Computer Science to strengthen this skill set by focusing on the successful deployment of embedded and critical systems and their possible interactions from a human-centred perspective.
